## Description

Taking a RESTful API and converting it into a MERN stack. This is the culmination of my last few weeks of learning React and MongoDB by coverting a RESTful API into a MERN stack application. Which is something that is done in the real world as websites convert from REST to React, making this a good exercise of interpreting code all written and converting it.
