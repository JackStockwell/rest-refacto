## Description

Taking a RESTful API and converting it into a MERN stack. This is the culmination of my last few weeks of learning React and MongoDB by coverting a RESTful API into a MERN stack application. Which is something that is done in the real world as websites convert from REST to React, making this a good exercise of interpreting code all written and converting it. This was also my first experience using GraphQL.

This was a fun, but debug filled endeavour took a good amount of debugging to find exactly where some issues lied and ensuring the front and backends were parsing and returning the correct data.

A struggle for me was ensuring all queries, mutations, typeDefs and resolvers where matching, as an incorrect query could lead to quite the headeache. Overally however, I gained a large amount of knowledge from this refactoring which has me grow my understanding of GraphQL, JWT and built upon my knowledge of React & MongoDB.
